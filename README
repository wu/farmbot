I'm currently learning how to use an arduino in order to automate a
lot of tasks on the geekfarm.

* Sensor Libraries:

These libraries monitor sensors such as soil moisture, humidity, and
temperature, and transmit the readings over the serial port (and
potentially to an xbee).  The data is transmitted every time the
sensor output changes beyond a set threshold.  Also the sensor output
is always sent at least once per minute, to ensure the sensor is still
online.

  - WubotTemperature - TMP421 temperature sensor
  - WubotSoilMoisture - vegetronix soil moisture meter
  - WubotHumidity - HIH-4030 humidity sensor

  
* WubotStatusLight

Use this library to report a status that will be displayed on a 3
color LED or a shiftbrite.  'warning' status to display yellow,
'critical' status to display blinking red, and 'unknown' displays
orange.  If the status is 'ok', then the light will fade randomly
between blue and pink.


* install.sh

Install the Wubot* libraries on OS X.


* Bots

The bots use the various Wubot libraries.

  - coopbot - runs in the chicken coop
  - growbot - prototype for the gardenbot
  - labbot - monitor temp in the lab and receive messages from other bots
  - devbot - my dev board

The bots each have an xbee to transmit the sensor data to the
coordinator on the labbot.  The labbot is plugged into an old apple
laptop over USB, which runs wubot, a personal reactive automation tool
available on github.  The sensor data is forwarded to the primary
wubot node which stores the sensor data in RRD files and builds a
bunch of graphs.  For more information, see wubot:

* libraries_3rdparty

Third party libraries that are used by farmbot.  Contains an install
script to install all the 3rd party libraries on OS X.


* attic

Contains lots of scripts that I built along the way, including some
scripts to run some of the sensors directly.


* t

Contains some ArduinoUnit unit tests for the Wubot libraries.
