I'm currently learning how to use an arduino in order to automate a
lot of tasks on the geekfarm.

* Sensor Libraries:

These libraries monitor sensors such as soil moisture, humidity, and
temperature, and transmit the readings over the serial port (and
potentially to an xbee).  The data is transmitted every time the
sensor output changes beyond a set threshold.  Also the sensor output
is always sent at least once per minute.

  - WubotTemperature - TMP421 temperature sensor
  - WubotSoilMoisture - vegetronix soil moisture meter
  - WubotHumidity - HIH-4030 humidity sensor

* WubotStatusLight

Use this library to report a status that will be displayed on a 3
color LED or a shiftbrite.  Possible states are:

 0 = ok, fade randomly between blue, purple, and pink
 1 = warning, blink yellow
 2 = critical, blink red
 3 = unknown, blink orange

* install.sh

Install the Wubot* libraries on OS X.


* Bots

The bots use the various Wubot libraries.  More bots are on the way.

  - labbot - runs in the computer lab.  monitor temps and receive messages from other bots
  - coopbot - runs in the chicken coop. monitor temps, control lights, with an LCD
  - growbot - runs in the greenhouse.  monitor temp, humidity, soil moisture
  - devbot - my dev board, cycles through various projects and prototypes

The bots each have an xbee to transmit the sensor data to the
coordinator on the labbot.  The labbot is plugged into an old apple
laptop over USB.  The sensor data is read using the SerialPort plugin
for wubot, a personal reactive automation tool available on github.
wubot stores the data in RRD files and generates graphs.  It also
sends me notifications when there are problems, e.g. the soil moisture
is getting low.  For more information, see wubot:

* libraries_3rdparty

Third party libraries that are used by farmbot.  Contains an install
script to install all the 3rd party libraries on OS X.


* attic

Contains lots of scripts that I built along the way, including some
scripts to run some of the sensors directly.


* t

Contains some ArduinoUnit unit tests for the Wubot libraries.
